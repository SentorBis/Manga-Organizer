As a mild digital hoarder, I found trying to keep track of 500+ folders was becoming ridiculous. So instead of an imperfect folder hierarchy, I've been fiddling with writing this program over the last month or so, and I think it's in an acceptable state for release. 

Basically, given folder titles of "[Artist] Title" (E-Hentai's format), it can automatically scan them into a database. After that you can search through the list by artist, title, tags and type. 

You'll need the .NET library to run it, but if you're running Vista/7 it should've come bundled with it. If it sounds useful to you, give it a shot. See the "Downloads" button ->

For an example of it running see:
