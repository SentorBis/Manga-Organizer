So instead of an awkward folder hierarchy, I've been writing this program to handle it for me, and I think it's in an acceptable state for release.\r\n\r\nBasically, given folder names of \"[Artist] Title\", it can automatically scan them into a database. After that you can search through the list by artist, title, tags and type.\r\n\r\n(<i>You'll need the .NET library to run it, but if you're running Vista/7 it should've come bundled with it.
