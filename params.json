{"name":"Manga-organizer","tagline":"This program provides tagging, searching and other basic management for a folder directory. It is intended as a companion to the E-Hentai website, and optimally functions with directory names formatted as \"[Artist] Title\"","body":"<h1 align=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/?2lqp4352wv74nfp\">Download</a></h1>\r\n<h3 id=\"version\" align=\"middle\">v. 03-31-2013</h3>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs a mild hoarder I found that a folder hierarchy simply doesn't cut it when you have 500+ folders to manage. No tags, stilted search functionality, no automation; it simply becomes a mess to find that specific manga you downloaded a month ago. So I got fed up with it and wrote a simple application to handle all this, and hopefully it's in an acceptable state to be useful to others as well.\r\n\r\nBasically it provides semi-automated metadata for your folders, along with the option to use a built-in 2-page image browser. It can automatically scan your current folders into a directory; which will fill out the artist, title, and page count fields. The same can be done by dragging and dropping a folder over the listview. Given a g.e-hentai gallery url it can auto-populate the remaining fields (exc. description). A tab for notes is also included to keep track of your always-full backlog.\r\n\r\n(<i>You'll need the .NET library to run it, but if you're running Vista/7 it should've come bundled with it. Otherwise, download it from here: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851\">.Net</a></i>)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- no install required\r\n- searches are cumulative, with terms separated by a comma\r\n- entry data can be automatically loaded from a g.e-hentai gallery url\r\n  (if you give it an exhentai link, it'll try to auto-load its g.e equivalent)\r\n- 'auto-magic' also applies to copy/pasted tags, gallery titles pasted into the artist field, and folders dropped onto the listview\r\n- browse images with your default image viewer (menu item: Open) or with the built in one (click on the cover image)\r\n- the latter browser displays two images simultaneously and should be traversed from right to left (Also, can hit 'f' to bring up a list of pages, then double-click on a page to open it)\r\n- to un-ignore an item in the scan operation, select it and press the ignore button again\r\n- if you set the root folder (Menu -> Change Root) to the root of your manga folder, the FolderBrowserDialog will try to auto-find the correct folder path when new items are added.\r\n- load the 'About' entry to automatically check for an updated version\r\n\r\nFor an example of it running: \r\n<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Browse.jpg\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Browse.jpg\"></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_View.jpg\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_View.jpg\"></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Notes.jpg\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Notes.jpg\"></a>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
