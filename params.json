{"name":"Manga-organizer","tagline":"This program provides tagging, searching and other basic management for a folder directory. It is intended as a companion to the E-Hentai website, and optimally functions with directory names formatted as \"[Artist] Title\"","body":"<h1 align=\"middle\"><a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103899726/Manga%20Organizer.exe\">Download</a></h1>\r\n<h3 id=\"version\" align=\"middle\"><a href=\"https://github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/blob/master/Changelog.md\">v. 05-14-2013</a></h3>\r\n<h4>Note: Searches now mimic EH's style: eg. \"title:celeb_wife -vanilla\"<br />\r\nYou can also search by 'date' and 'pages', and apply less/greater-than operatives: eg. \"date:>01/01/12\"<br />\r\nNote #2: Added .zip support (sorry, no rar/7zip/etc support just yet)</h4>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">As a mild hoarder I found that a folder hierarchy simply doesn't cut it when you have hundreds of folders to manage. No tags, stilted search functionality, no automation; it simply becomes a mess to find that specific manga you downloaded a month ago. So I got fed up with it and wrote a simple application to handle all this, and hopefully it's in an acceptable state to be useful to others as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Basically it provides semi-automated metadata for your folders, along with the option to use a built-in 2-page image browser. It can automatically scan your current folders into a directory; which will fill out the artist, title, and page count fields. The same can be done by dragging and dropping a folder over the listview. Given an EH gallery url it can auto-populate the remaining fields (exc. description). A tab for notes is also included to keep track of your always-full backlog.</p>\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- no install required\r\n- searches function similarly to EH's<br /> \r\n  (eg. title:celeb_wife date:>01/01/12 -vanilla)\r\n- entry data can be automatically loaded from an EH gallery url\r\n- 'auto-magic' also applies to copy/pasted tags, gallery titles pasted into the artist field, and folders dropped onto the listview\r\n- browse images with your default image viewer (Menu->Open) or with the built in one (click on the cover image)\r\n- the latter browser displays two images simultaneously and should be traversed from right to left (Also, hit 'f' to bring up a list of pages then double-click on a page to open it)\r\n- to un-ignore an item in the scan operation, select it and press the ignore button again\r\n- if you set the root folder (Menu -> Change Root) to the root of your manga folder, the program will try to auto-find the correct folder path when new items are added.\r\n- open 'Menu->About' to automatically check for an updated version\r\n\r\nFor an example of it running: \r\n<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Browse.jpg\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Browse.jpg\"></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_View.jpg\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_View.jpg\"></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Notes.jpg\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Notes.jpg\"></a>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
