{"google":"","tagline":"This program provides tagging, searching and other basic management for a folder directory. It is intended as a companion to the E-Hentai website, and optimally functions with directory names formatted as \"[Artist] Title\"","note":"Don't delete this file!

So instead of an awkward folder hierarchy, I've been writing this program to handle it for me, and I think it's in an acceptable state for release.\r\n\r\nBasically, given folder names of \"[Artist] Title\", it can automatically scan them into a database. After that you can search through the list by artist, title, tags and type.\r\n\r\n(You'll need the .NET library to run it, but if you're running Vista/7 it should've come bundled with it. Otherwise, download <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851\">.Net</a> for Windows or <a href=\"http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html\">Mono</a> for Linux/OSX.)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- no install required\r\n- searches are inclusive, with terms separated by a comma\r\n- entry data can be automatically loaded from a g.e-hentai gallery url\r\n  (if you give it an exhentai link, it'll try to load its g.e equivalent automatically)\r\n- 'auto-magic' also applies to copy/pasted tags, full titles, and folders dropped onto the listview\r\n- browse images with your default image viewer (menu item: Open) or with the built in one (click on the cover image)\r\n- the latter browser displays two images simultaneously and should be traversed from right to left\r\n- to un-ignore an item in the scan operation, select it and press the ignore button again\r\n- if you set the root folder (Menu -> Change Root) to the root of your manga folder, the folderbrowserdialog will try to auto-find the correct folder path when new items are added.\r\n\r\nFor an example of it running: \r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/blob/master/preview.jpg?raw=true\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/blob/master/preview.jpg?raw=true\"></a>","name":"Manga-organizer"}
