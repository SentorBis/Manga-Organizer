No tags, stilted search functionality, no automation; it simply becomes a mess to find that specific manga you downloaded a month ago. So I got fed up with it and wrote a simple application to handle all this, and hopefully it's in an acceptable state to be useful to others as well.\r\n\r\nBasically it provides semi-automated metadata for your folders, along with the option to use a built-in 2-page image browser. It can automatically scan your current folders into a directory; which will fill out the artist, title, and page count fields. The same can be done by dragging and dropping a folder over the listview. Given an EH gallery url it can auto-populate the remaining fields (exc. description). A tab for notes is also included to keep track of your always-full backlog.\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\nNotes:\r\n- no install required\r\n- searches function similarly to EH's, with terms separated by a space and the \"-\" prefix used to block unwanted ones\r\n  (eg: -netorare)\r\n- entry data can be automatically loaded from an EH gallery url\r\n- 'auto-magic' also applies to copy/pasted tags, gallery titles pasted into the artist field, and folders dropped onto the listview\r\n- browse images with your default image viewer (menu item: Open) or with the built in one (click on the cover image)\r\n- the latter browser displays two images simultaneously and should be traversed from right to left (Also, can hit 'f' to bring up a list of pages, then double-click on a page to open it)\r\n- to un-ignore an item in the scan operation, select it and press the ignore button again\r\n- if you set the root folder (Menu -> Change Root) to the root of your manga folder, the FolderBrowserDialog will try to auto-find the correct folder path when new items are added.\r\n- load the 'About' entry to automatically check for an updated version\r\n\r\nFor an example of it running: \r\n<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Browse.jpg\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Browse.jpg\"></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_View.jpg\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_View.jpg\"></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Notes.jpg\"><img src=\"https://raw.github.com/Nagru/Manga-Organizer/master/Prv_Notes.jpg\"></a>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
